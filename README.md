### What I learned

A small trick I learned while building this app:

#### Make textarea grow with text

After two days of doing research, I figured the best way to achieve it is using javascript. 
- Set its height to an empty string (don’t set it to 0px like many suggestions you might find on stackoverflow). If you don’t do this step, textarea’s height will grow each time you enter something. 
- Then set its height to scrollHeight + some margin.
- Then set its parent element’s overflow-y to hidden.


```ts
  onChange={(e) => {                
                        if(textAreaRef.current){
                            setContent(textAreaRef.current.value);
    
                            textAreaRef.current.style.height = '';
                            textAreaRef.current.style.height = textAreaRef.current.scrollHeight + 8 + 'px';
                            
                        }
    
                    }}
```
